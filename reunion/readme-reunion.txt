Return of the Evil Majordomo!
Lady Delcia's ghost!
Answers from Alianna and Gorion!
A SECRET adversary!
Angry succubi and more!

The Reunion MOD for Baldur's Gate II (Reunion for short) is an add-on for 
the game Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal.

You are the Child of Bhaal, and your journey is nearly complete. But after
you arrive to Amkethran, Nalia approaches you with distressing news. Her castle
is once again under attack, this time by demons, and her people are in danger.

Will you come? And what does the mysterious attacker want from you?

As you proceed through the keep, you learn that your adversary has a very
strong reason to want to meet you. But all is not as clear as it may seem...

Learn your mother's true story, look into Gorion's eyes, and ask the questions
you've always wanted answered.

To start the quest, you have to have Nalia in your party in Chapter 9.

You can summon Nalia via the Fate Spirit and let her go afterwards:
her presence in the mod is recommended for more dialogue, but not required.

2. Installation
----------------

Windows:
--------

Make sure that you have obtained and installed the latest official Bioware patch.
Install the official patch BEFORE installing any unofficial modifications.

To save you time and effort, it is recommended to backup dialog.tlk, chitin.key,
baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override directory before installing any mods.
This way, you can restore your "clean install" in seconds by deleting weidu.log,
dialog.tlk, chitin.key, baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override directory,
and restoring backups. (For Enhanced Edition users: also backup /lang directory).

Make sure that Baldur's Gate II or ANY game-related utilities are not running.

To install the mod, unpack the archive into your Baldur's Gate folder
and run Setup-Reunion.exe

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-Reunion.exe in your game directory.


Mac OS X:
---------

If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting
the new version.

To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder.
If properly extracted, you should have a Reunion folder,
Setup-Reunion, and Setup-Reunion.command in your BG2 folder.

To install, simply double-click Setup-Reunion.command
and follow the instructions on screen.

In case of difficulties:

1. Open the Terminal, type 'chmod +x' followed by a space, drag 
Setup-Reunion.command into the window, press enter.
2. Type 'chmod 755' followed by a space, drag Setup-Reunion
into the window, press enter.
3. Double-click Setup-Reunion.command,
the installation process should now proceed.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-Reunion.command
in your game directory.

3. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: How can I start the mod?
A: Make sure you are in Chapter 9. It begins when you enter Amkethran.
Then make sure that Nalia is in your party(you can summon her via the Fate
Spirit). She will talk to you then.

Q: Should I expect any interaction from my party members?
A: Nalia talks a lot, if you take her along. Other Bioware party members
have an interjection or three, as always.

Q: I have a problem with one of the quests.
A: Take a look at the walkthrough in the readme, or your in-game journal.
You can always use your teleportation stone to return to Amkethran.

Q: Are there any new areas?
A: No, but you will see Nalia's castle again. Perhaps some nostalgic value?

Q: Is Reunion compatible with mod X?
A: It should work fine with other mods. I am using different area codes for 
Nalia's Keep in ToB, so technically it should be compatible with anything.

4. Walkthrough (SPOILERS!)
------------------------------

SPOILERS START HERE

At any given time you can use the wardstone to be teleported to
Amkethran and back to Nalia's Keep.

Nalia will talk to you from time to time, if you take her along,
but those conversations do not advance the plot.

1) Reach Chapter 9 (arrive to Amkethran).
2) If Nalia is not in the party, summon her via the Fate Spirit.
3) Talk to Nalia. You will be given a wardstone that would teleport
you to her keep.
4) Talk to the fleeing guy at the gates.

Optionally: go to the palisade. The side quests start there.

a) Captain Arat asks you to go find his son. His son is outside
the Keep, just go up the stairs to find him.
b) Jessup asks you to find Chanelle. She is inside, on the ground floor,
in the room where the forge used to be.
c) Miranda wants you to find Wes. He will be outside, and you'll
passs him on the way from the palisade to the bridge after talking 
to Miranda.
d) Gheed wants an idol of Lathander. That's on the ground floor,
in the room behind Chanelle, inside a statue. Be warned, though:
Gheed will not pay you for it, you'll only get experience.

5) Daemon is on the ground floor, on the right from the main entrance.
6) Once you go up the stairs from the room where you meet Daemon,
Alianna greets you.
7) Move clockwise, and Alianna talks to you again in the library.
8) The next conversation with Daemon happens in the hall with
three statues, the one that can be used as a chapel in the figher
stronghold.
9) The third conversation with Daemon happens in the basement,
in the throne room. You'll have a choice - to fight him or not.
10) If you do not fight him, three demons appear, and you have to
kill them all to talk to Daemon again.
11) After the final fight with Daemon OR after Daemon's departure
Alianna appears, and  you have the last conversation with her.
After that, you can leave the castle.
12) Rest in the pocket plane and talk to Gorion one last time.

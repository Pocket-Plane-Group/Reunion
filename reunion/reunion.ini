Description = The Reunion MOD for Baldur's Gate II (Reunion for short) is an add-on for the game Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. It is compatible with all BGII games: BGII, BGII:EE, BGT, and EET!

You are the Child of Bhaal, and your journey is nearly complete. But after
you arrive to Amkethran, Nalia approaches you with distressing news. Her castle
is once again under attack, this time by demons, and her people are in danger.

Will you come? And what does the mysterious attacker want from you?

As you proceed through the keep, you learn that your adversary has a very
strong reason to want to meet you. But all is not as clear as it may seem...

Learn your mother's true story, look into Gorion's eyes, and ask the questions
you've always wanted answered.

To start the quest, you have to have Nalia in your party in Chapter 9.

You can summon Nalia via the Fate Spirit and let her go afterwards:
her presence in the mod is recommended for more dialogue, but not required.
